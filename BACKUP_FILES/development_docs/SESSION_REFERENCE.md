## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Core Files:**
- **`app.js`** - Main backend application (WhatsApp bot core)
- **`start.bat`** - Windows launcher with auto-setup
- **`setup-business.js`** - Interactive business configuration wizard
- **`config.json`** - Business-specific settings (auto-generated)
- **`.env`** - Google Sheets credentials

- **Column E (index 4)**: Customer Name
- **Column F (index 5)**: Phone Number (with country code)

### **Message Flow:**
```
New Lead in Google Sheets (after filter date)
↓
Welcome Message: "Dear {name}, Thank you for reaching us through Meta Ads. Welcome to {businessName}. Please find our catalog below:"
↓ (3 seconds delay)
PDF Catalog with caption: "Thank you for reaching out to us at {businessName}. Please have a look at our {productType}."
↓
Both logged in CSV files
```

## 🛡️ Advanced Features Implemented

### **1. Smart Duplicate Prevention:**
- Checks what's already been sent before sending anything
- Handles scenarios: welcome sent but PDF failed, PDF sent but welcome failed
- Uses processing locks to prevent simultaneous sends to same number
- Memory cache for faster duplicate checking

### **2. System Health Monitoring:**
- Tracks Google Sheets API calls and failures
- Monitors WhatsApp connection status
- Sends alerts to admin (8851165191) for:
  - 3+ consecutive Google Sheets failures
  - 30+ minutes without successful API call
  - WhatsApp disconnections
  - System crashes/restarts

### **3. Failure Recovery:**
- **No Internet**: Continues retrying, sends alert after multiple failures
- **Google Sheets Issues**: Tracks failures, alerts admin, auto-recovers
- **WhatsApp Disconnected**: Shows QR code, sends recovery notification when back
- **System Crash**: On restart, checks what was sent, only sends missing messages
- **PDF Missing**: Sends welcome + text caption, logs error

### **4. Message Clash Prevention:**
- 3-second delay between welcome and catalog
- Message sending locks prevent simultaneous sends
- Smart timing based on what's already been sent
